            Usb c dc MORS Code, Yeditepe University,

        </h4>
        <p>
            Created morse code by utilizing STM microeconomics board.
        </p>

        <h4>
            VELOSTAT, Yeditepe University,
        </h4>
        <p>
            Created weight measuring system using the STM board and Velostat, which is a pressure-resistant conductive sheet. STM board was coded via STM32CubeIDE with the help of my c programing knowledge. 

        </p>

        <h4>
            Temperature Sensor, Yeditepe University,
        </h4>
        <p>
            Designed temperature sensor by utilizing STM board. Code is written in STM32CubeIDE and used c programing knowledge while writing the code.

        </p>

        <h4>
            Air Flow Sensor and Data Filtering, Yeditepe University
        </h4>
        <p>
            In this project, I measured the results of the chemistry department with an anemometer. With the code wrote from Mbed Studio, ı was able to connect the STM card to anemometer. Then I started to read the results.
